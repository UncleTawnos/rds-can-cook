title: Meatballs with mashed potatoes, cream sauce and stirred lingonberries
category: Main courses
shortdescription: Swedish meatballs is a dish that serves both as a traditional Smörgåsbords-must have - for example at Christmas - as well as a standard family weekday dish.
ingredients: For four people
Meatballs
- 600 g minced beef
- 1/2 dl (0.2 cups) dry breadcrumbs
- 2 dl (0.8 cups) double cream (thick cream)
- 1 small yellow onion
- 1 egg
- Butter (for frying onion)
- 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Freshly minced black pepper to taste (3-4 pinches)
- More butter (for frying meatballs)

Mashed potatoes
- 10 potatoes (800 g)
- 50 g butter
- 1 dl milk + 1 dl double cream
- Salt and freshly minced white pepper to taste

Rårörda lingon (stirred lingonberries)
- 5 dl lingonberries
- 2 dl sugar

Cream sauce
- 1 yellow onion
- 1/2 carrot
- 1 table spoon butter
- 2 dl meat stock / broth
- 3 dl double cream (thick cream)
- A few splashes Soy sauce to taste and for the color (I prefer the Japanese Kikkoman brand) 
- Salt and freshly minced white pepper to taste

directions:
Cream sauce
- Peel and hack onion and carrot. Fry in a kettle with butter until golden. 
- Add the stock and cream.
- Simmer until the sauce thickens.
- Strain the sauce, add salt, pepper and just a few splashes of soy souce to taste (careful so it doesn't overtake the sauce). 

Meatballs
- Put the dry breadcrumbs to soak and expand in the cream
- Peel and mince the onion. Chop it really really finely, should be almost goo-like. Fry the onion in butter on lower heat until its just starting to become brown. Put aside to cool down.
- Mix the meat properly with onion, the breadcrumbs/cream mix plus the egg. Add pepper and salt.
- Form the meatballs with your hand. I prefer smaller ones. You should be able to do ~35 meatballs with this recepie. 
- Fry the meatballs in a large frying pan on high heat in a generous amount of butter. When they are fried properly leave them on lower heat in the pan for around 5 minutes.

Rårörda lingon 
- Rårörda lingon (stirred and sweetened lingonberries) is a popular accompaniment to main courses in Sweden, especially some of the classic Swedish dishes such as meatballs and Raggmunk
- Rårörda lingon is made by adding sugar to the berries and stirring them (or shaking them) until the sugar dissolves. (Rårörda is really two words joined together: rå means raw and rörda means moved/stirred/shaken.
- Put the lingonberries and stir until the berries are mushy and the sugar dissolves.
- You will probaly get some left over after serving this meal for four persons, it can be kept in fridge for a couple of weeks.

Mashed potatoes
- Peel and boil the potatoes until they are really soft. 
- Pour the water away and mash the potatoes, either by hand with a fork or an electric mixer. I prefer to make it into a really smooth cream without being lumpy by just using a fork.
- Add the butter and milk mixed with cream. Add salt and freshly minced white pepper to taste.

Serve the meatballs with mashed potatoe, the cream sauce and Rårörda lingon.
