title: Bannock
category: side dishes
shortdescription: Bannock is a dense and hearty quick bread with Irish, Scottish, and Northern English origin going back to the 8th century. Originally made with unleavened oatmeal or barley, this simple recipe can be created with a variety of flours, including white, wheat, almond, cornmeal. 
ingredients: Ingredients for 8-10 servings:
- 3 cups of flour
- 2 tblsp baking powder
- 2 tblsp white sugar (or sugar substitute)
- 1 tsp salt
- ¼ cup butter or shortening
- 1 cup milk (or almond milk)
- 1 ½ cups of mashed potatoes (or instant potatoes)
- Optional: 1 tblsp of butter and/or sea salt 
directions:
1.  Pre-heat the oven to 232°C (450°F)

2.  Peel, quarter and boil the potatoes, or prepare the instant potatoes.

3.  Add all dry ingredients to a large bowl or mixer and blend them together evenly. 

4.  Add the butter and milk, and mix. The dough will still be very dry, and not completely mix together.

5.  Once the potatoes have been cooked, lightly mash the potatoes, but keep them a little chunky. Add them to the dough mixture, and on a slightly floured surface, knead the mixture until it becomes a firm ball of dough. The dough should not be too sticky, so sprinkle additional flour, as needed.

6.  On a lightly greased baking sheet, flatten the dough to a maximum 1-inch thickness. At this stage, you can spread some additional melted butter and/or salt to the top of the bannock, if desired.
	
7.  Bake for 15 – 20 minutes until golden brown and remove from heat. 

8.  You can slice and serve immediately, while hot, or let cool for 5-10 minutes. Best served hot with butter, honey, or on its own. Makes an amazing side dish to soups and stews. Refrigerate leftovers in tupperware or plastic wrap.
