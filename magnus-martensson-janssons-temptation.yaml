title: Janssson's Temptation
category: main courses
shortdescription: This is a gratin made from potatoes, onion and anchovies (sprat filets). It is described already in 1928 and is known as a great meal any time. It can be prepared in advance and chucked in the oven as a late night snack at the after party.
ingredients: For 6–8 servings
  1.2 kg potatoes
  400 g onions
  375 g spice-cured sprat filets (sprattus sprattus). Anchovies is a very close approximation. All those little fish are much the same.
  600 ml heavy whipping cream
  white pepper and a little salt
  butter
directions:
  Open the sprat tins and pour the liquids inside into a glass for later.
  Peel the potatoes and cut them into strips.
  The coarse grain on a regular food processor is ideal here.
  Peel and cut the onions into thin slices, sautéing them gently in a little butter without browning.
  Grease an ovenproof baking dish.
  Cover the bottom with about half of the potatoes.
  Lay the sprat (‘anchovy’) filets evenly on the potatoes.
  Add the onions.
  Finish with the rest of the potatoes.
  Flatten the surface.
  Apply some turns of pepper fresh from the mill and sprinkle on a little salt (the fish is salty so be careful).
  Pour the liquid from the tin on top and pour the cream on until it is almost visible through the potatoes.
  Place several pats of butter on top and, if desired.
  Bake in the oven (250°C/475°F) for about an hour.
  Serve preferably with hard bread with butter and cheese, and of course cold beer!
