title: Marvellous Merlot Mince 
category: main courses
shortdescription: This simple one pot dish produces a rich sauce that is packed with flavour; it developed when I couldn't finish a bottle of wine and had some staples handy!
ingredients: For 4 people
    500g Lean Beef Mince
    1 Onion finely diced
    100 - 150ml Merlot
    6 cloves of Garlic crushed or 1 tbsp of Garlic Puree
    1/2 tsp crushed chilli
    1 tsp Sweet Paprika
    350ml Passata
    1/2 tbsp or 1 sachet Tomato Puree
    1 Beef Stock Cube or Concentrated Beef Stock Pot
    Good quality Extra Virgin Olive Oil
    Seasoning to taste
directions:
    Pre-heat oven to 180 C
    In a large oven proof pan, brown mince on the stove and then remove from pan to drain fat.
    Add olive oil to pan and fry diced onion until soft and transluscent.
    Return mince to pan, add chilli and paprika.
    Add passata, wine, stock cube/pot, tomato puree and garlic puree.
    Stir and season well.
    Turn up heat on pan and bring sauce to a low simmer.
    Place a lid on pan and put in hot oven for 1 hour.
    After 30 minutes, give sauce a stir.
    At the end of cooking the sauce should have reduced by about a third and become thick.
    If the sauce looks too thick, add a small amount of water to loosen.
    Serve with mashed potato and some green vegetables, or with pasta and a side salad.
    The sauce can be made as spicy as required, and instead of chilli and sweet paprika, 2 tsp of hot paprika can be used.
