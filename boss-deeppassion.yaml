category: sweet
shortdescription: Family favourite, a simple to make cake, full of flavour, a kind of a passion fruit drizzle cake!
ingredients: For 4-6 people
    6 passion fruit
    140g caster sugar
    100 ml of sunflower oil
    2 eggs
    50 ml full fat natural yoghurt
    150 g self raising flour
    1 tsp baking powder
    40g ground almonds
    3 limes, zested/juiced
    100 g icing sugar
directions:
    Pre-heat the oven to 180C, 160C (fan), gas mark 4.
    Grease and line an 8" cake tin with grease proof paper. 
    Take 4 passion fruit, scoop out the insides, and press through a sieve, keeping the juice. 
    Zest and juice 2 limes. 
    Combine, with a whisk, the caster sugar, oil, eggs, yoghurt and passion fruit juice in a bowl.
    Sift the flour and baking powder into the same bowl.
    Add the ground almonds and the zest/juice of the 2 limes.  Beat until everything is combined. Then put in the tin.
    Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until a metal skewer can be inserted and removed clean.
    Take the cake from the oven and place it on a rack to completely cool. 
    Press the pulp of the remaining 2 passion fruit through a sieve, combine with the zest/juice of the remaining lime.
    Slowly add the icing sugar until it reaches your preferred icing consistency (I prefer thicker so it doesn't run down the sides).
    Spread evenly over the top of the cake.
