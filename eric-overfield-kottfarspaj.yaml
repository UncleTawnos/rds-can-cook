title: Köttfärspaj (Pork Pie)
category: main courses
shortdescription: Pork Pie in a traditional old swedish way, where potatoes are used as an additional filler. One of my favorite go-to meat pie like recipes, each to cook, hearty, makes great left-overs.
ingredients: Ingredients for 1 pork pie
- 1/2 - 1 teaspoon Ground peppar
- 1 Garlic
- 1 Pepper
- 1 can Corn kernels
- 1 teaspoon Oregano
- 2 Egg
- 150 - 200 ml Shreeded cheese
- 2,5 tablespoon Tomato puree
- 400 ml (gram) Grounded Pork
- 1 yellow Onion
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 1 - 2 cooked cold Potatoes
- 2 rolls of pie dough (often 2 rolls of dough in one package)
directions:
1.  Pre-heat the oven to 225°C (425°F)

2.	Peel and chop the onion. Chop the pepper.

3.  Fry the pepper for 3 minutes on hot skillet, then add the onion. Fry pepper and onion until everything has a nice yellow-brown color. Add in the pork and split with a wooden fork. Fry on skillet, stirring until the pork has cooked (light brown).

4.	Turn heat to skillet to simmer. Add tomato puree, corn, salt and pepper to the skillet. Season the minced meat sauce with oregano, pressed garlic and shredded potatoes.

5.	Press one roll of pie dough into a pie mold so that the bottom and edges are covered. Prick the dough with a fork. Bake in the middle of the pre-heated oven for about 10 minutes.

6.	Crack 2 eggs in a small bowl. Whisk the eggs with a fork and mix down grated cheese. Mix eggs and cheese batter into the cooling pork batter in the skillet.

7.	Pour the pork batter into the baked pie shell.

8.	Take the second roll of pie dough and cut into strips to cover the pie. If it gets extra, feel free to make a pattern or write text as decoration. (you can use a gingerbread cookie cutter) 

9.	Bake further for about 15 - 25 minutes in the center of the oven. Watch for 15 minutes so the dough does not burn.

10.	Let cool for 5-10 minutes, serve with a salad. If you want it more spicy, add spices when you prep the pork. One thing I like to add is taco seasoning mix.
