title: Lovely Lamb Shanks 
category: main course
shortdescription: Lamb shanks are a great cut of meat, both impressive looking and tasty; here I cook them slowly to ensure the flaouvr is packed in and the meat drops off the bones.
ingredients: For 4 people
    4 Lamb Shanks
    500ml Vegetable Stock
    1 tin Crushed Tomatoes
    1 Onion sliced
    6 cloves of Garlic crushed or 1 tbsp of Garlic Puree
    4 large stalks of Rosemary
    Large splash Worcestershire Sauce
    Plain Flour 
    Seasoning
directions:
    Pre-heat oven to 140 C.
    In a large food bag, add 2 tbsp Plain Flour and season with salt and pepper.
    Add Lamb Shanks to bag, and ensure they are fully coated with flour.
    In a large frying pan, add some oil and brown the flour covered lamb shanks one at a time on all sides.
    Place browned lamb shanks and any leftover flour in a large oven proof pan. 
    Add tin of tomatoes and stir to combine with the flour.
    Add vegetable stock, onion, garlic and Worcestershire Sauce and stir again.
    Nestle the stalks of rosemary in the sauce and place the pan on a stove over a medium heat.
    Keep an eye on pan to make sure things don't stick and bring sauce to a low simmer.
    Place in oven and cook for 4 hours.
    At the end of cooking time, carefully remove the lamb shanks and cover with foil.
    Place pan on stove, and keep stirring over a medium heat until the sauce has reduced by about a third, then remove rosemary stalks.
    Place one lamb shank each in a bowl with some mashed potatoes and green vegetables and spoon the sauce over.
    If you have some crusty bread, you can use it to mop up the sauce afterwards!
