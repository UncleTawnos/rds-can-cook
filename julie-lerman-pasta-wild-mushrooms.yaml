title: Pasta with Wild Mushrooms
category: main courses
shortdescription: I've been growing my list of foraged mushrooms that can be trusted and I'm still alive to tell the tale. You can also buy them from a trusted vendor of course. Here's one way to enjoy them, sauteed and slathered on top of pasta. I've done this recipe with puffballs, giant puffballs, oysters and chanterelles.
ingredients: 
1/2 lb or more of mushrooms, cleaned and sliced into bite sized pieces
2 tbsp butter (more is always better)
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves garlic crushed or minced
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1/2 cup fresh sage leaves, chopped
1/8 cup fresh thyme
Salt & pepper

1 lb of your favorite pasta

directions: 

Cook the pasta and reserve about 1/2 c of the pasta water

Put the olive oil and garlic into a room temperatur pan then heat it up on a low flame to ensure the garlic doesn't burn
Add the onions and cook for a few minutes
Add pasta water as needed to prevent sticking, 1/2 tsp at a time.
Add the mushrooms. Stir constantly. 
After a few minutes add the sage and thyme.
COntinue sauteeing and stirring. Do not stop stirring. 
Different mushrooms take different lengths of time to cook through. Get a glass of wine and be prepared to sample them for doneness as needed.
Add salt and pepper to taste while still sauteeing.
Add some of your wine if you can spare it.
The herbs shoud be soft.
Add butter as needed.

When the composition is soft and the mushrooms are cooked to perfection, pile it on top of the pasta and enjoy!
